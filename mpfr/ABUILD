shortdesc=("mpfr (Multiple-Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library)")
longdesc=("The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding). It is based on the GMP multiple-precision library. The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation which is both efficient and has well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).")
