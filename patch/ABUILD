longdesc=("Patch is a utility used to apply diffs (or patches) to files, which are usually source code. Larry Wall wrote the original version of patch. Paul Eggert removed patch's arbitrary limits; added support for binary files, setting file times, and deleting files; and made it conform better to POSIX. Other contributors include Wayne Davison, who added unidiff support, and David MacKenzie, who added configuration and backup support.")
